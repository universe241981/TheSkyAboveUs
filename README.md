If use Pi0W and connected to home network, the PHP can be view as normal without any problem.
But if Remot3it was setup and view the PHP page via remot3it, Pi0W will halt from operation. <-- Not all Pi0W has this problem. If you are lukcy, your Pi0W will run smoothly without any problem.
This only happen on Pi0W. Other RPi board got no issue at all.
