An all sky imaging system that use Raspberry Pi(all type of RPi mainboard except Pi 4) and Pi camera (official or China made)

If use Pi0W and connected to home network, the PHP can be view as normal without any problem.
But if Remot3it was setup and view the PHP page via remot3it, Pi0W will halt from operation. <-- Not all Pi0W has this problem. If you are lukcy, your Pi0W will run smoothly without any problem.
This only happen on Pi0W. Other RPi board got no issue at all.

The latest Meteotux Pi is the one with file name "meteotux_pi".

The "meteotux_pi_1_3_9" is the bug version of "meteotux_pi". But the advantage of this version is, we can use it under serious light pollution sky.

The "meteotux_pi_works_with_stretch_kernal_4.9" is the obsoleted version which no longer available on Meteotux Pi website.
